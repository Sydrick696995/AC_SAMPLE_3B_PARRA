## 📌 Introduction
This project showcases the practical use of cryptography in securing digital communication. It demonstrates how different cryptographic techniques protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity through text and file encryption/decryption, and hashing.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- To implement a range of symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing algorithms.
- To create a simple UI-based application using Streamlit.
- To educate users on the history, use cases, and working of each cryptographic method.

---

## 🏗️ Application Architecture
The application is built using Streamlit, providing a clean and interactive interface. Users can switch between encryption, decryption, and hashing modes, upload files, or input text directly.

---

## 🔐 Implemented Algorithms

### 🔸 AES
- **Type:** Symmetric
- **History:** Standardized in 2001 by NIST.
- **Use Cases:** Secure messaging, data storage.

### 🔸 RSA
- **Type:** Asymmetric
- **History:** Introduced in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman.
- **Use Cases:** Digital signatures, secure key exchange.

### 🔸 SHA-256
- **Type:** Hash Function
- **History:** Part of the SHA-2 family, published by NIST in 2001.
- **Use Cases:** Password hashing, data integrity.

*(Repeat for all algorithms.)*

## 🚀 Deployment
The application can be run locally using:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
--- 

## 🚀 Need to install
The application need to install the following:
```
streamlit
- pip install pycryptodome
- pip install cryptography
```
